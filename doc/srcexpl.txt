INTRODUCTION						*srcexpl-introduction*

SrcExpl (Source Explorer) is a source code explorer that provides context for
the currently selected keyword by displaying the function or type definition
or declaration in a separate window. This plugin aims to recreate the context
window available in the IDE known as "Source Insight".

The behaviour of the Source Explorer window is similar to that of "Source
Insight". Placing your cursor on a function name in Normal Mode will cause its
definition to be displayed in the Source Explorer window. Double-clicking the
definition will cause the edit window to jump to the definition. In addition,
listing multiple definitions and jumping work in a similar fashion to
"Source Insight".

Source Explorer uses ctags to track keywords and can automatically create and
update the generated tags file for you.

Source Explorer is designed to work with other plugins like 'The NERD tree'
and 'taglist' to further recreate a "Source Insight"-like environment or to
work in your own configuration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES						    *srcexpl-features*

    * Display definitions and declarations of various languages supported
      by ctags and various types including functions, macros, structures,
      arrays, methods, classes, and variables.
    * Jump to the displayed context in the Source Explorer window using the
    * mouse or your own key mapping.
    * Jump back from the context location with the mouse context menu or your
      own key mapping.
    * Automatically list all definitions if multiple definitions for a keyword
      is found.
    * Automatically create and update the tags file.

==============================================================================
INSTALL							     *srcexpl-install*

1. Ensure ctags is installed on your system and that VIM can use it.
2. Place the Source Explorer files in your Vim directory (such as ~/.vim) or
have it installed by a bundle manager like Vundle or NeoBundle.
3. Open the Source Explorer window with |:SrcExpl| or |:SrcExplToggle| or map
these commands to keys in your .vimrc.

							   *srcexpl-uninstall*
To uninstall Source Explorer, simply delete the Source Explorer files and
remove any related lines in your .vimrc. You may remove any generated tags
files in your projects or keep them for further use as they can be used by vim
without Source Explorer.

==============================================================================
INTERFACE						   *srcexpl-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS						    *srcexpl-commands*

:SrcExpl							    *:SrcExpl*
	Opens the Source Explorer window.

:SrcExplClose						       *:SrcExplClose*
	Closes the Source Explorer window.

:SrcExplToggle						      *:SrcExplToggle*
	Toggles the Source Explorer window on and off.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VARIABLES						   *srcexpl-variables*

g:SrcExpl_winHeight					 *g:SrcExpl_winHeight*
	This controls the default height of the Source Explorer window when it
	is started.

	Default: 8

g:SrcExpl_refreshTime				       *g:SrcExpl_refreshTime*
	This controls how often in milliseconds the Source Explorer window is
	updated.
        You must keep the cursor on the desired word for this period of time 
        for SrcExpl to display its definition.
	Note: This sets the |updatetime| setting which also controls how often
	the swap file will be written to disk.

	Default: 100

g:SrcExpl_pluginList					*g:SrcExpl_pluginList*
	This list contains the names of buffers to ignore when displaying
	context information. At the very minimum it must include itself.
>
	" Minimum Plugin List
	let g:SrcExpl_pluginList = [ "Source_Explorer" ]
<
	You should add the name of each buffer every other plugin you have uses
	to avoid conflicts and compatibility issues.
>
	" Example
	let g:SrcExpl_pluginList = [
		    \ "__Tag_List__",
		    \ "_NERD_tree_",
		    \ "*unite*"
		    \ ]
<

	Default: [ "__Tag_List__", "_NERD_tree_" ]

g:SrcExpl_searchLocalDef			    *g:SrcExpl_searchLocalDef*
	This enables local definition searching. Source Explorer can use vim's
	local definition search in addition to ctags to find definitions.
	However, this is not guaranteed to work. See the vim documentation for
	|gd| for more details.

	Default: 1

g:SrcExpl_isUpdateTags				      *g:SrcExpl_isUpdateTags*
	This enables automatic tags file updating whenever Source Explorer is
	opened.
	If a tags files is not found, you will be asked if you wish to create
	a tags file in the current directory.
	The command used to create or update the tags is set by 
	|g:SrcExpl_updateTagsCmd|.

	Default: 1

g:SrcExpl_updateTagsCmd				     *g:SrcExpl_updateTagsCmd*
	The command used to create or update the tags file. This is run when
	Source Explorer is opened if |g:SrcExpl_isUpdateTags| is set or
	whenever |g:SrcExpl_updateTagsKey| is pressed. The command will run in
	the current directory.

	Default: "ctags --sort=foldcase -R ."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS						*srcexpl-key-mappings*

g:SrcExpl_jumpKey					   *g:SrcExpl_jumpKey*
	Set this variable to the key you want to use to jump to the highlighted
	definition in the Source Explorer window.
	Note: This mapping only works in the Source Explorer window.
	Note: Source Explorer uses its own mark list and normal mark commands
	will not work.

	Default: '<CR>'

g:SrcExpl_gobackKey					 *g:SrcExpl_gobackKey*
	Set this variable to the key you want to use to go back to the previous
	location after jumping to a definition.
	Note: Source Explorer uses its own mark list and normal mark commands
	will not work.

	Default: '<SPACE>'

g:SrcExpl_updateTagsKey				     *g:SrcExpl_updateTagsKey*
	Set this variable to the key you want to use to force a update of the
	tags file.

	Default: ''

g:SrcExpl_prevDefKey				        *g:SrcExpl_prevDefKey*
	Set this variable to the key you want to use to display the previous
	definition in the jump list.

	Default: ''

g:SrcExpl_nextDefKey				        *g:SrcExpl_nextDefKey*
	Set this variable to the key you want to use to display the next
	definition in the jump list.

	Default: ''

==============================================================================
TIPS								*srcexpl-tips*

1. Ensure that there is only one tags file in your project PATH or you Source
Explorer will show duplicates of every definition.
For example: There are two tags in the 'your_project' directory, so we will
delete the excess 'tags' files in the 'sub_directory'.
>
 [chewenlong@localhost ~]$ cd your_project/ 
 [chewenlong@localhost your_project]$ pwd 
 /home/chewenlong/your_project 
 [chewenlong@localhost your_project]$ ls 
 bar.c  sub_directory  tags 
 [chewenlong@localhost your_project]$ cd sub_directory/ 
 [chewenlong@localhost sub_directory]$ ls 
 foo.c  tags 
 [chewenlong@localhost sub_directory]$ rm -rf tags 
 [chewenlong@localhost sub_directory]$ ls 
 foo.c 
 [chewenlong@localhost sub_directory]$ cd .. 
 [chewenlong@localhost your_project]$ ls 
 bar.c  sub_directory  tags 
 [chewenlong@localhost your_project]$ vim bar.c 
<

							*srcexpl-line-endings*
2. Ensure that all the files you are exploring are using unix line endings. If
they are not, a '^M' will be displayed at the end of the line and Source
Explorer will jump to incorrect locations.

						    *srcexpl-console-mappings*
3. If you are using Source Explorer in a UNIX console, these are my suggested
key mappings for jumping between windows and using Source Explorer:
>
 nmap <C-H> <C-W>h 
 nmap <C-J> <C-W>j 
 nmap <C-K> <C-W>k 
 nmap <C-L> <C-W>l 
 
 nmap <C-I> <C-W>j:call g:SrcExpl_Jump()<CR> 
 nmap <C-O> :call g:SrcExpl_GoBack()<CR> 
<

							     *srcexpl-trinity*
4. If you want to set up vim to work more like Source Insight, you can try a
vim plugin named Trinity (trinity.vim) available at: 
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2347

The Trinity plugin manages Source Explorer, Taglist and NERD Tree. The below
shows my work platform with Trinity.

CHANGELOG						   *srcexpl-changelog*

5.3
- Fix a bug when operating the Quickfix window after closing the Source Explorer window.
- Handle the case when the cursor is located at the Quickfix window as same as other
  external plugins.

5.2
- Add the fast way for displaying the previous or next definition in the jump list.
  The new feature is similar with the commands called cprev and cnext for operating
  the Quickfix list. You can add below config lines in your .vimrc or just update your
  Trinity to v2.1.
    1. " // Set "<F3>" key for displaying the previous definition in the jump list 
       let g:SrcExpl_prevDefKey = "<F3>" 
    2. " // Set "<F4>" key for displaying the next definition in the jump list 
       let g:SrcExpl_nextDefKey = "<F4>" 
- Fix a bug when clicking the default prompt line in the Source Explorer window.

5.1
- Added two APIs for serving other plugins:
    1. SrcExpl_GetWin(), getting the Source Explorer window number for those plugins
       based on multiple windows.
    2. SrcExpl_GetVer(), getting the Source Explorer version for the forward compatibility.
- Added debug/logging functions for the internal development.

5.0
- Replaced use of preview window with a named buffer.
- Moved to github.
- Added documentation.
